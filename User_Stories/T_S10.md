Title: `Tree Logical View of UI`
  - Priority: `2`
  - Units (Story Points): `2`
  - `There may be more than one projects in the workspace, and each projects may have many files, which may have many methods, and so forth. Therefore, it would be nice if the view is arranged in a tree format, so that all the entities are arranged in a logical order of project > package > source > methods. This would make it more straightforward to understand the plugin.`
